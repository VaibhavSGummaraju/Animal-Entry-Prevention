The Animal Entry Prevention project aims to create an intelligent security solution
that ensures only humans can access specific areas, effectively preventing animals from
intruding into restricted zones. This project integrates Arduino technology with advanced
machine learning techniques to develop a reliable and efficient barrier against
unwanted animal entry.
The project addresses various needs, such as protecting agricultural fields from wildlife,
ensuring urban and residential safety.It offers a robust, efficient, and cost-effective
solution for various applications, providing peace of mind and significant economic
benefits to users.
